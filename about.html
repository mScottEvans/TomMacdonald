      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        MacDonald grew up in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. He later
        worked as a professional wrestler under the ring name Allstar. MacDonald
        struggled with alcoholism throughout much of his life, and in 2017, had
        a "bad breakdown" that prompted him to begin rehabilitation.MacDonald
        started rapping at age 18, and first rose to fame after releasing the
        single "Whiteboy" in February 2018. His song "Straight White Male",
        which was written about MacDonald's belief that straight white men are
        being demonized, was criticized on social media for its subject matter.
        In September 2019, MacDonald released the single "Cloned Rappers", on
        which he rapped about the conspiracy theory that the Illuminati are
        cloning rappers and disposing of the originals. In late 2019, MacDonald
        was scheduled to be a supporting act for Falling in Reverse's Episode IV
        Tour before it was canceled. In 2020, he released 20 singles, including
        "White Trash", "Sellout", "Best Rapper Ever", "Cancer", and "Angels". In
        March 2020, MacDonald released the single "Coronavirus", which was
        written about the COVID-19 pandemic.

        In January 2021, MacDonald released the single "Fake Woke", which
        debuted at number 96 on the Billboard Hot 100. After Eminem released a
        series of NFTs as part of his "Shady Con" event with Nifty Gateway,
        MacDonald purchased one—an Eminem-produced instrumental called "Stan's
        Revenge"—for $100,000. MacDonald used the instrumental to create his
        song "Dear Slim", released in May 2021. The song's accompanying music
        video paid homage to the music video for Eminem's 2000 song "Stan". In
        June 2021, he released "Snowflakes", which debuted on the Billboard Hot
        100 at number 71, surpassing "Fake Woke" to become MacDonald's
        highest-charting song.The music video featured right-wing political
        commentator Blaire White as a background dancer. His single
        "Brainwashed", released in August 2021, peaked at number 89 on the
        Billboard Hot 100.
